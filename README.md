# Installation 

Before running different versions you must first add them to the source path and remove the other 2 if previously opened.
e.g. if attempting to run V2, remove V1 and V3 from source path.
You may have to mess around with the source path.

**So if you were attempting to run PetTest.java in Version 3 you would need to right click the src folder in V1 and V2 and make sure to remove them from the source path and then right click the src folder in V3 and add it to the source path.**
